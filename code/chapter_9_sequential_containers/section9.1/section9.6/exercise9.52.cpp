// Exercise 9.52:
// Use a stack to process parenthesized expressions.
// When you see an open parenthesis, note that it was seen.
// When you see a close parenthesis after an open parenthesis,
// pop elements down to and including the open parenthesis off the stack.
// push a value onto the stack to indicate that a parenthesized expression was replaced.
